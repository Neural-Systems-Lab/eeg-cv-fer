EEG &amp; Computer Vision based Facial Expression Recognition

## Setup and Installation

1. Make sure that you are using python version 3.6. This project may work for other versions of python but it was tested on version 3.6.8 (64-bit)

2. Install all python dependencies using `[path to python executable] -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the models directly from python

Model Runner Usage:

`[path to python executable] modelRunner.py [-n, --modelName] defaultcv [-l, --labelFrequency] 2 [-f, --dataFrequency] 2 [-d, --dataPath] video_or_eegfilename`

Example commands:

`python modelRunner.py -n defaulteeg -l 2 -f 128 -d s01_trial01.npy`

`python modelRunner.py -n defaultcv -l 2 -d s01_trial01.avi`

Note that the cv models do not use the dataFrequency argument.

Output generated by the models will be placed in the ./output directory
